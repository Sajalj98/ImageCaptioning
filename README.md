# ImageCaptioning


Key Skills: Image Processing CNN LSTM Keras jupyterlab tqdm numpy


The objective of our project is to learn the concepts of a CNN and LSTM model and build a working model of Image caption generator by
implementing CNN with LSTM.
The image features will be extracted from Xception which is a CNN model trained on the imagenet dataset and then we feed the features into the
LSTM model which will be responsible for generating the image captions.
